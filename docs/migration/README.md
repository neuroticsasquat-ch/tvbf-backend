# Migration artifacts

Fixed home for the TMDB migration's reconciliation baseline (NEU-1030) and the
one-off repair scripts the migration's production runs turn out to need. The
location is pinned here rather than improvised at cutover, because milestone 5's
go/no-go re-runs the same harness against the same file — and because a
procedure that only exists in somebody's terminal history is a procedure that
will not survive to the day it is needed.

## `reconciliation-baseline.json`

Per-user, per-show counts of tracked shows, episode watches, show ratings,
episode ratings and activity events, plus totals. Produced by
`python -m tvbf.jobs.reconcile capture`.

Deterministic: sorted users, sorted shows, sorted keys, trailing newline. Two
captures of an unchanged database are byte-identical, so `git diff` on this file
is meaningful and a real change is never lost in reordering noise.

It holds user **ids**, never emails — it is committed. Names are resolved from
the live database only when a discrepancy is reported.

### Capturing the baseline (production)

The baseline that matters is production's, taken **before** any cutover work.
The artifact travels on stdout, because `docs/` is not in the production image
and a Coolify container is replaced on every deploy:

```bash
ssh tom@ssh.neuroticsasquat.ch \
  'docker exec <tvbf-backend-container> python -m tvbf.jobs.reconcile capture' \
  > docs/migration/reconciliation-baseline.json
```

Commit the result. Locally, `task reconcile:capture` writes the same file from
the dev database — useful for trying the harness out, **not** a substitute for
the production baseline.

### Verifying

```bash
# local
task reconcile:verify

# production, baseline on stdin
ssh tom@ssh.neuroticsasquat.ch \
  'docker exec -i <tvbf-backend-container> python -m tvbf.jobs.reconcile verify --baseline -' \
  < docs/migration/reconciliation-baseline.json
```

**Exit 0 means nothing moved; exit 1 means something did**, and every
discrepancy prints with the user and the show it belonged to. Gains fail as
loudly as losses — an unexpected gain during a cutover window means something
ran that should not have.

After cutover, add `--spine catalog` so the episode→show joins resolve against
the new schema. The show ids are unchanged by design (TV Maze ids are preserved
as `catalog.show.id`), which is what lets one baseline span both spines.

## `neu-1043-collision-remediation.sql`

**Executed against production 2026-08-10.** 107 collisions, 18 repairable: 18
guesses retracted, 18 exact matches stamped, and no row on either side carried
user data. NEU-1043 orders the mapping tiers correctly within a show but not
between shows, so a tier-3 title guess on a low-id row could take a `tmdb_id`
that a higher-id row matched exactly. NEU-1065 fixes the cause in code; this
script repaired the data.

Kept runnable rather than reduced to a record: another enrichment pass before
NEU-1065 lands would produce the same class of collision, and its inspection
queries are reusable against any run's log.

**Its input is the run's log, not the database.** The database records that a row
is unmatched, never that it lost a contest or to whom, so the collisions have to
be lifted out of the enrichment log first — step 1 in the file's header. Lose the
log and the only way back is another enrichment run, capturing the warnings.

It repairs only collisions that were *logged*. A tier-3 false positive that
contested nothing is invisible to both the log and the database, and is caught
only by reading `match_method = 'title_year'` rows by hand.

## The human matching queue (NEU-1044)

No artifact here — the queue is a query, run live, because a snapshot of it goes
stale the moment somebody resolves a row. `python -m tvbf.jobs.human_queue`, and
`src/tvbf/tmdb/human_queue.py` explains what it surfaces and why.

**Its output names users by email and does not belong in this directory.** That
is the deliberate opposite of `reconciliation-baseline.json` above, which holds
ids because it is committed; the queue names people because "who would lose
data" is what decides how hard to look at a row. Read it and discard it.

**Run it before the full TMDB ingest.** Once the ingest has inserted a row per
series, the series a queue row should map onto already holds that `tmdb_id`, and
`confirm` can only report the collision.

```bash
# every user-touched show without a verified mapping, plus TMDB candidates
task queue:list

# the same, no upstream calls and no credential — the fast "is it empty?" check
task queue:list -- --no-candidates

# production
ssh tom@ssh.neuroticsasquat.ch \
  'docker exec <tvbf-backend-container> python -m tvbf.jobs.human_queue list'
```

Then one command per row, each of which is a recorded verdict:

```bash
task queue:confirm -- <show_id> <tmdb_id>   # this show IS that TMDB series
task queue:reject  -- <show_id>             # TMDB has no counterpart; stays locally-authored
```

**Exit 0 means the verdict was written; exit 1 means it was refused** — an id
another row already holds, a row matched exactly (which the queue never
surfaced), or a second verdict over an existing one. `list` exits 0 either way:
it is a report, and *empty* is what the cutover gate reads out of it.

### The four production guesses confirmed on 2026-08-10

NEU-1044's ticket records four `title_year` matches checked by hand and found
correct — but the check lived only in the ticket, where the rows still read
`match_method = 'title_year'`, indistinguishable from an unreviewed guess.
Re-stamping them is what moves that verdict into the database:

```bash
task queue:confirm -- <show_id> 119955   # Dr. Brain
task queue:confirm -- <show_id> 225634   # Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story
task queue:confirm -- <show_id> 241849   # You Are What You Eat: A Twin Experiment
task queue:confirm -- <show_id> 299737   # The Traitors Ireland Uncloaked
```

`confirm` with the id a row already holds re-stamps it rather than refusing, so
these are exactly the four commands and nothing else. Take each `<show_id>` from
`task queue:list` rather than from here — the catalog id is a local surrogate and
was never in the ticket.

*The Traitors Ireland Uncloaked* is the only one carrying watch history (12
episode watches), and confirming its show id is necessary but not sufficient:
those watches must also map at episode grain, which is NEU-1045's.

## Episode-grain mapping (NEU-1045)

No artifact here either — the pass writes to the database and the report is a
query, run live and read once, for the same reasons the queue above is.

**Run it after `task enrich:tmdb-ids` and before the full TMDB ingest.** The
episode upsert conflict-targets `tmdb_id`, and a copied episode row carries
none: run the ingest first and every matched show ends up holding each episode
twice — a TMDB row with a fresh id, and the copied row that
`app.user_episode_watch` actually points at. Stamping the copied rows first is
what makes the ingest update them in place instead.

```bash
# the pass: one request per matched show, resumable, safe to kill
task map:episodes
task map:episodes -- --limit 100     # smoke run first

# production
ssh tom@ssh.neuroticsasquat.ch \
  'docker exec <tvbf-backend-container> python -m tvbf.jobs.episode_map map'
```

Then read the residue. Unmatched episodes are the expected output rather than a
failure — a two-parter counted once upstream and twice here has no key to match
on — so the report surfaces only the ones somebody would lose something over:

```bash
task map:episodes:report
```

Four things in it are worth reading, in this order:

1. `unmirrored_watches` — watched episodes with **no `catalog.episode` row at
   all**, which every other number in the report is computed without. The TV
   Maze daily keeps adding episodes until cutover and every one added after
   `task copy:catalog` ran is watchable while having nothing to map, so this is
   expected to be non-empty on any day the copy has not just been re-run. The
   fix is operational: re-run `task copy:catalog`, then this. The CLI logs it as
   an error above the counts for the same reason.
2. `systematic_shows` — a matched show where **nothing** mapped. That is a claim
   about the show rather than its episodes, and usually means the `tmdb_id`
   NEU-1043 attached belongs to a different series, which `task queue:confirm`
   fixes. Check it against the run's log first: the flag is `0 of N mapped`, and
   a show whose fetch failed during the pass satisfies that exactly as well —
   the database cannot tell those apart, but the pass's per-show warnings can.
3. `unmatched_user_data` — every unmapped episode carrying a watch or a rating,
   worst first. Each row keeps its TV Maze data and its watch record whatever
   happens; the entry is there so a systematic pattern on a popular show is
   visible rather than inferred. `synthetic: true` marks a row the copy invented
   a negative number for — a null-numbered TV Maze special, permanently
   unmappable and not a mismatch to investigate.
4. `totals.watched_episodes_unmapped` — the number the cutover gate reads.

The report only means anything **after** the pass: before one, every matched
show has zero mapped episodes and reads as systematic.

Two rows are genuinely unmapped and need a decision either way: *Cunk on Earth*
(several *Cunk* entries, so the rule refused to guess) and *Discretion* (no
premiere date, excluded from tier 3 by design). Neither carries watch history.
